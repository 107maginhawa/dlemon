## §2 Retention Policies

| Entity | Retention Period | Auto-Purge? | Archive Strategy | Locale Notes |
|--------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| `Patient` (demographics) | Duration of care + 10 years (PH) / 6 years (GDPR) | No | Anonymize on erasure; retain for legal minimum | PH: RA 9439; EU: GDPR Art. 17 |
| `Visit` + clinical data | 10 years from last encounter (PH) / 8 years (UK/AU) / 7 years (US) | No | Retain minimum; anonymize patient link on erasure | [VERIFY per locale] |
| `Treatment` | Same as Visit | No | Same as Visit | — |
| `Prescription` | 5 years (PH) / 2 years (EU) | No | Retain; anonymize patient link | [VERIFY per locale] |
| `ImagingStudy` + S3 | 7 years clinical minimum | No | Delete S3 object + DB metadata on erasure | Must delete radiographs on GDPR erasure request |
| `PMDDocument` | Permanent (signed export) | **NO — cannot delete** | Cannot delete signed PMD per compliance | PMD signing is non-repudiable |
| `Invoice` / `LineItem` | 7 years (financial / tax) | No | Anonymize patient link; retain for tax audit | All locales: 7-year financial records |
| `AuditEvent` | 7 years minimum | No | Append-only; no deletion ever | HIPAA audit trail requirement |
| `ConsentForm` | Duration of care + 10 years | No | Retain; mark revoked | Must be available for litigation |
| `MedicalHistoryEntry` | Same as Visit | No | Same as Visit | — |
| `Appointment` | 1 year from date | Yes (after 1 year) | Soft-delete | Admin only |
| `Authentication sessions` | Session expiry (ADR-007 — [UNSPECIFIED]) | Yes | Auto-expire | [RESOLVE: define session TTL] |
| `Person` PII fields | Linked to Patient retention | No | Anonymize on erasure (replace with pseudonym) | GDPR Art. 17 + BR-020 patient merge |

## §3 Right to Deletion (GDPR Art. 17 / RA 10173 §34)

| Entity | Hard Delete? | Anonymization Method | Cascading Effects | Audit Trail Preserved? |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| `Person` | No — Anonymize | Replace name/DOB/contact with synthetic pseudonym | Patient profile anonymized; dental records retain clinical data only | Yes — audit log retains actorId (now pseudonym) |
| `Patient` | No — Anonymize | Unlink from Person; replace with `[ERASED]` marker | Visits/treatments retain clinical codes; patient name gone | Yes |
| `Visit` / `Treatment` | No | Anonymize patient reference | CDT codes, procedure codes retain for statistical/billing compliance | Yes |
| `Prescription` | No | Anonymize patient reference | Drug name retains; patient identity gone | Yes |
| `ImagingStudy` | Partial — S3 delete | Delete S3 object (radiograph); retain metadata with anonymized patient ref | CephAnalysis anonymized | Yes |
| `PMDDocument` | **No** — legal hold | Cannot delete signed PMD | PMD remains; patient name may be anonymized in DB record | Yes |
| `Invoice` | No | Anonymize patient name; retain for 7-year tax compliance | LineItems retain CDT codes; patient identity gone | Yes |
| `AuditEvent` | **No** — never | Append-only; no deletion | None | N/A (is audit trail) |
| `ConsentForm` | No — keep state | Mark as `[ERASED]`; consent record anonymized | Downstream consent checks may fail — requires care | Yes |
| `Appointment` | Yes (after 1 year) | Hard delete | None | Audit event before delete |

**Erasure Workflow:** [WFG-006 — not yet implemented]
> Implementation required: orchestrated erasure across Patient, Visit, Treatment, Prescription, ImagingStudy, Invoice. Requires cross-module coordination. Tracked as G-012 (PHI encryption gap) and WFG-006 (erasure workflow).

## §4 Right to Export (GDPR Art. 20)

| Entity | Exportable? | Format | Includes Related? | Implemented? |
|--------|------------|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| `Patient` demographics | Yes | JSON / PDF | Yes — visit history, consents | **No — [WFG-006]** |
| `Visit` clinical records | Yes via PMD | PDF (PMD format) | Yes — treatments, chart, prescriptions | Yes (per-visit PMD) |
| `Invoice` history | Yes | PDF / CSV | Yes — line items, payments | **Partial — no bulk export** |
| `Prescription` history | Yes | PDF | Yes — drug + dosage + date | **No** |

| Data erasure request | — | Patient request | N/A — triggers erasure workflow | WFG-006 |

**Consent record structure (JSONB on Person):**
```json
{
  "granted": boolean,
  "granted_at": "ISO8601",
  "ip_address": "string",
  "updated_at": "ISO8601",
  "updated_by": "personId"
}

## §6 Data Lineage

| Entity | Field | Source | Transformation |
|--------|-------|--------|---------------|
| `Treatment` | `cdt_code` | Dentist selects from FeeSchedule | Stored as-is; copied to InvoiceLineItem |
| `Treatment` | `price_cents` | FeeSchedule default; dentist may override | Integer cents; no floating point |
| `Invoice` | `total_cents` | Sum of LineItem.price_cents | Computed; tax = 0 (BR-010 stub) |
| `PMDDocument` | `checksum` | SHA-256 of serialized visit snapshot | Computed at generation; verified on import |
| `ImagingAnnotation` | coordinates | Dentist draws on image | Pixel-space coordinates; stored as JSONB |
| `CephLandmark` | `x, y` | Dentist places on ceph radiograph | Pixel coords → calibrated mm (via calibration method) |
| `Person.marketing_consent` | `ip_address` | Captured at registration | Stored verbatim; not transformed |

|---------|----------|------------|
| AG-1 | Exact retention periods per locale | [VERIFY]: PH=10y, EU=varies by record type, US=7y minimum |
| AG-2 | Audit log retention period | **7 years** — HIPAA minimum; append-only, never deleted |
