# verify-app — repeatable end-to-end verification system

> **Status tracker (committed on purpose).** Durable, openable status of the multi-PR effort
> to build one re-runnable verification system so human QA stops finding systemic bugs.
> Update the checkboxes as phases land. Pause → resume from the first unchecked box.

**Goal:** One command (`bun run verify:app` + `/verify-app` skill) that proves the wired/shipped
surface works end-to-end and **computes + ratchets** every gap. Replaces the prior AHA pipeline's
slow, manual, prose audit with a fast, deterministic, parallel system.

**The reframe:** AHA *discovered* gaps by hand (15 sequential rounds, prose `MASTER-GAP-MATRIX.md`
that can't be re-run, stalled on 24 product decisions). This *computes* them as a set-diff over the
machine-readable sources we already have (`contract-spine.json`, `br-registry.json`, `*_TRANSITIONS`
enums, `ROLE_PERMISSION_MATRIX.md`, `WORKFLOW_MAP.md`), and turns AHA's adversarial battery into
automated parallel probes.

**Coverage bar:** *cover-what-ships + compute-the-rest.* Everything wired/shipped is covered +
adversarially verified; orphan / deferred / decision-gated gaps are computed and **allowlisted with a
reason** (visible, not blocking). NOT chasing the 109 leftover AHA gaps — those are product work.

**Honest ceiling:** drives the *escape rate* (bugs QA finds ÷ total) toward near-zero for the **known**
bug classes; every escaped bug ratchets a new oracle. Not literal zero bugs.

**Out of scope:** Tauri/`api-ts-embedded`, `cadence` offline-sync, `apps/website`. Targets the web
product (`apps/dentalemon` + `services/api-ts`).

## Tiers (each independently invokable)

| Tier | When | Proves | Budget |
|------|------|--------|--------|
| **0 — Computed gates** | every commit (CI) | what's untested (set-diff) + ratchet | seconds |
| **1 — Functional proof** | pre-merge / on-demand | the wired surface works for users now | 3–5 min |
| **2 — Adversarial sweep** | pre-release / weekly | tests non-vacuous + nobody can break it + affordances real | 15–30 min (parallel) |
| *3 — (deferred)* | — | auto-completeness-critic, QA-exit gate, escape-rate loop, J22+ journeys | — |

`bun run verify:app` = Tier 0 + 1 (+ invokes the existing 16 CI gates); `--deep` adds Tier 2.

## Governance (anti-drift)
1. **One phase, one PR, fully merged before the next** (the Stop-the-Drift discipline).
2. **Committed tracker, not memory** — this file.
3. **Allowlists can only shrink** — every `*.allowlist.json` entry carries a `reason`; new entries need
   explicit human sign-off in the PR. Role↔spec **drift is never allowlisted**.
4. **Non-vacuity is proven, not assumed** — reverting a historical fix must turn a matrix/probe RED.

## Progress

### Phase 1 — Highest-ROI bug discovery + computed engine
- [x] **1a — Role×operation drift detector. ✅ DONE** (`scripts/coverage/role-op-matrix.ts`, 21 unit
      tests; `bun run coverage:roles[:ci]`, `--check` hard-fails on any drift — drift is never
      allowlisted). Scanned **110 role-gated ops**, found **3 drifts → triaged to 0**:
      - **Real authz bug FIXED** (`fix(authz)` `65df7636`): the wired `initializeDentition` blocked
        `dental_assistant` (spec + sibling `updateTooth` grant it); a **dead duplicate handler** held the
        correct roles. Fixed the wired handler, deleted the duplicate. **Also exposed a vacuously-green
        test** (`dental-assistant.clinical-assist.test.ts` asserted assistant→201 against the DEAD
        handler) — retargeted to the canonical path (the "false-green test wiring" class, caught by a
        *computed* check).
      - **2 detector false-positives** (`dc00767b`): the spec's summary *tables* can't express
        `treatment_coordinator` (case-presentation) or the hygienist E3 check-in, but the *prose* grants
        them and code matches → modeled as cited `PROSE_DOCUMENTED_GRANTS` (spec-completion, not
        allowlisting). Drift = 0.
      - **Visibility for later:** 82 of 110 gated ops are not in the spec matrix tables (the matrix
        documents 28). Not drift; "compute-the-rest" backlog for spec coverage.
      - **Blocking CI gate** for role drift lands with the unified `coverage-ratchet` job in 1c (it needs
        `contract-spine.json` regenerated in CI; `.understand-anything/` is gitignored).
- [ ] **1b — Schemathesis shadow→blocking.** Blocking profile (`not_a_server_error,status_code_conformance`)
      over all 369 ops; spec-precision findings stay advisory.
- [ ] **1c — Computed coverage engine + 6 matrices.** Shared `scripts/coverage/lib/{sources,scan-tests,
      ratchet}.ts` + endpoint / br / fsm / role-op / workflow / fe-route generators → `docs/testing/coverage/`.
      Env-gated `COVERAGE_RECORD` recorder in `test-app.ts` + journey client. Replace `audit:trace:ci`
      with `coverage:br:ci`. New `coverage-ratchet` CI job.
- **Verification gate:** 6 matrices generate + commit; `coverage-ratchet` green; 0 un-triaged
      `drift:true`; Schemathesis-blocking green; **non-vacuity proof** (revert a historical fix on a
      scratch branch → a matrix/probe goes RED; re-apply → GREEN).

### Phase 2 — The repeatable button (Tiers 0–1)
- [ ] `package.json` `coverage:*` scripts; generalize coherence oracles (`test-utils.ts`) + BE twin
      `assertEndpointTotalEqualsRepoSum`.
- [ ] `scripts/verify-app.ts` (Tier 0 + Tier 1 + invoke existing 16 gates → one `VERDICT.md`) + `--deep` flag.
- [ ] `.claude/skills/verify-app/SKILL.md` wrapper.
- **Verification gate:** `bun run verify:app` runs against the reseeded real stack → one VERDICT.md;
      Tier-1 journey harness green; coherence oracles pass; skill returns a readable summary.

### Phase 3 — Adversarial deep sweep (Tier 2) — re-plan in detail at phase start
- [ ] Mutation spike + harness (4 critical module-classes; seed the 8 historical bugs; **0 surviving
      historical-bug mutants** is a hard gate) → `mutation-score.json`.
- [ ] 26-module **parallel** skeptic fan-out (AHA battery: cross-tenant 2-org, illegal-FSM, IDOR,
      role-reject+zero-rows-on-403, audit-row, validator-drift) → committed RED→GREEN pins; verdicts
      become `READY (refuted-and-survived)`.
- [ ] 4 per-role persona walks (Webwright/`/browse`) with adversarial briefs → pinned findings.
- [ ] Refresh `/understand-anything` knowledge graph; wire `understand-diff` into `/review`.
- **Verification gate:** mutation kills all seeded historical-bug mutants; skeptic fan-out across 26
      modules all `refuted-and-survived`; ≥1 clean persona walk per role (or filed pinned findings).

## Discipline
Verify "works for users" by running the real-stack proof (Tier 1) and the deep sweep (Tier 2) and
citing their artifacts — not by reporting green unit/coverage numbers as proof of function.
