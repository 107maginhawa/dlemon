# Module Audit Tracker — 2026-06-08

Per-module deep audit + safe-gap closure. Product-first clinical vertical sequence
(15 audit rounds; bounded-context modules fold into their parent). One commit per module.

**Sequence:**
dental-org → dental-patient → dental-scheduling → dental-visit → dental-clinical → dental-perio →
dental-imaging → dental-pmd → dental-billing → dental-audit → erasure/legal-hold/retention →
dental-portal → emr-consultation → provider → external-records-import

## Cross-module carry-forward

- ~~**BR-016c (imagingTier gate)** — declared in dental-org §5 but enforced/tested in dental-imaging.~~
  **RESOLVED 2026-06-08 (dental-imaging round).** The gate is implemented as strict `imagingTier !== 'addon'`
  at study create (cephalometric/CBCT) AND on every ceph endpoint, blocking free/basic/null with 403
  IMAGING_TIER_REQUIRED. br-registry CIMG-001/002 reconciled (had understated `basic` as allowed). Tests
  pin free→403, basic→403, null→403, addon→pass.
- **AC-ORG-002** fee-schedule → new-invoice default: dental-org proves the per-branch override;
  the invoice-time price snapshot is billing-side — verify in the **dental-billing** round.
- ~~**BR-015b archived = read-only (product decision)**~~ **RESOLVED 2026-06-08.** Re-verification
  shows the EF-PAT-001 guard (`patient.status==='archived'` → 403 `PATIENT_ARCHIVED`) is now
  pervasive across all sub-resource writers (insurance/contacts/alerts/tasks/household-create/
  treatment-plan/case-presentation/consent/follow-up) — the round-2 note was stale. The lone
  straggler `removeHouseholdMember` (had no guard while its sibling `addHouseholdMember` did) was
  fixed this session (403 `PATIENT_ARCHIVED` + test). Scope decision = enforce (not narrow).
- **PATCH-status-field bypass class (from dental-scheduling)** — a generic `PATCH {status}` update
  path can bypass the narrower RBAC/validation enforced by a transition's dedicated endpoint. In
  scheduling, `PATCH {status:'cancelled'}` bypassed the owner/staff_full cancel restriction (fixed)
  and still bypasses the BR-SCH-003 reason requirement (surfaced). **Check every module with a
  generic status-PATCH against its dedicated transition endpoints** (visit checkout/lock, treatment-plan,
  consent, claim FSM) for the same role/validation asymmetry.
  - **dental-visit instance found + fixed:** `applyTemplate` was an alternate treatment-creation
    path with weaker RBAC than `createDentalTreatment` (assertBranchAccess vs assertBranchRole).
    Keep checking alternate-path writers (templates, carry-over, bulk ops) in every module.
- **Asymmetric FSM transition guards (from dental-clinical V-CLN-010).** A state machine
  with two terminal exits (e.g. consent signed⊥revoked) can guard one direction but not the
  other: `revoke` blocked signed→revoke, but `sign` did **not** block revoke→sign, producing a
  contradictory signed+revoked row that the downstream `signed=true`-only gate honored — letting
  a treatment proceed on a revoked consent. **For every paired terminal transition, check BOTH
  guards are symmetric AND that any read-gate filters on the full invariant (signed=true AND
  revoked=false), not just one flag.** Recurs anywhere a status read-gate (billing, completion,
  treatment) trusts a single boolean.
- **Generic update handlers may skip the immutability guard the create handler enforces
  (from dental-clinical `updatePrescription`).** All five clinical *create* handlers block
  writes to a locked/completed visit (BR-003), but `updatePrescription` had no such guard.
  **RESOLVED 2026-06-08:** `updatePrescription` now blocks field edits on a locked/completed
  visit (422 `VISIT_IMMUTABLE`) while still allowing status FSM progression (dispense/cancel are
  external, per the lab-order §13 carve-out) — tests pin both. The *pattern* still stands: check
  every module's *update* path for the immutability guard its *create* path enforces.
- **Absence-of-evidence must not be inferred as a clinical signal (from dental-perio IDEAL-§343).**
  `classifyChart` defaulted `remainingTeeth` to the count of teeth *charted* on a (partial) perio
  exam, so a fully-dentate patient charted on <20 teeth tripped the `<20 teeth` Stage-IV factor and
  was over-staged — and a test had *enshrined* the wrong result. **For every derived clinical/scoring
  default, check that an omitted optional input is treated as "no evidence" (passed through as
  undefined), not silently substituted with a structurally-related but semantically-different value.**
  Recurs anywhere a classifier/score fills a missing risk input from the data at hand.
- **A whole module can be missing from br-registry (from dental-perio).** dental-perio's BR-P01..P07
  + V-PER codes were entirely absent from `br-registry.json` (8 of 10 dental modules registered).
  **When auditing a module, confirm it has a registry block at all** — not just that individual rules
  are present.
- **Caller-supplied branchId is not an auth boundary (V-PAT-002 → V-VIS-011).** A `branchId`
  query param that is access-checked but never tied to the path resource (patientId) leaks
  cross-tenant. dental-patient (list visits/conditions) and dental-visit (treatment-plan
  get/accept/version) both had it. **Audit every patient/resource-scoped read+write that takes
  a `branchId` query param** in the remaining modules (billing, pmd, portal, emr) — authorize
  against the resource's own branch, not the param.
  - **dental-imaging = the SAFE pattern (no hole found).** Every imaging handler derives branch
    from the resource (`study.branchId`, or image→study), then `assertBranchAccess/Role`; the
    `listPatientImages?branchId=` repo filters images by `branchId` AND the caller must be a member
    of it, so a member of a different branch sees zero rows (no leak). The 2026-06-08 round only
    ADDED the missing *test* for this (a same-org member of `OTHER_BRANCH` is denied a `BRANCH_ID`
    radiograph) — it was correct by source but unpinned. **Cross-branch isolation should be tested
    with a member of a *different* branch (full role), not just a no-membership `OUTSIDER` — the two
    deny for different reasons and only the former proves the resource-scoped-branch invariant.**
  - **dental-pmd = also the SAFE pattern (no hole found) — 2026-06-08.** dental-pmd trusts **no
    `branchId` query param at all**; visit-scoped handlers derive branch from `visit.branchId`,
    patient-scoped handlers from `patient.preferredBranchId` (the patient resource's own branch,
    org-scoped so it can't cross an org boundary), then `assertBranchAccess/Role`. The round only
    ADDED the missing cross-branch *tests* (a full-role `dentist_owner` of `OTHER_BRANCH` is denied
    the patient's PMDs/care-record). **Carry-forward branchId-auth-boundary class is now CLEAR for
    org/patient/scheduling/visit/clinical/perio/imaging/pmd — the holes found (and fixed) were
    confined to dental-patient + dental-visit, which took a `branchId` *query param* untied to the
    path resource. The remaining modules to chase are billing, portal, emr.**
- **A br-registry rule can UNDERSTATE a gate, not just be absent (from dental-imaging CIMG-001).**
  CIMG-001 said the ceph tier gate blocks "free or null" — but the code is strict `!== 'addon'`, so
  `basic` is blocked too (a test already proved it). **When a registry rule enumerates the blocked
  set, re-derive it from the operator in code** (`!== 'addon'` ⇒ everything except addon), not from
  the prose. Same class as a stale "only one analysis type exists" claim after N shipped (CIMG-010).
- **A MODULE_SPEC can list PHANTOM schema columns / wrong routes a sibling doc already fixed (from
  dental-pmd §7/§10).** API_CONTRACTS had already been reconciled to the inline-JSON reality
  (V-PMD-006), but MODULE_SPEC §7 still listed `storage_file_id`/`format_version`/`imported_pmd.branch_id`
  columns that don't exist and §10 still listed the wrong list route + multipart upload. **When two
  spec docs for a module disagree, diff BOTH against the schema/routes — don't assume the
  most-recently-edited one propagated its fix.** Re-derive the column set from `*.schema.ts` and the
  route set from `generated/openapi/routes.ts`, not from prose.
- **KG node summaries can carry a wrong domain-term EXPANSION + a phantom route (from dental-pmd).**
  The graph expanded "PMD" as "Patient medical data" (canonical is "**Portable** Medical Document",
  V-PMD-009), cited a non-existent `POST /dental/pmd/generate` (real: `POST /dental/visits/:visitId/pmd`),
  and claimed out-of-scope "recall management". **Treat KG node prose as DESCRIPTIVE-and-possibly-stale:
  verify the acronym expansion against MODULE_SPEC §2 and every cited route against the generated
  routes before trusting a summary.** Query-only — flag for next regeneration, never hand-edit the KG.
